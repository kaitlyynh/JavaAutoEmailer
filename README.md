This project uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to store user information into databases on SQL.
Users can register their information into the database and subscribe to different emails based on their
recorded profession -- e.g Doctor, Security Guard, Teacher

Frontend is designed using pure Java Graphics
Emailing capability is supported using Java Activation Framework (JAFA) features that include JavaMail APIs.

Components that render will vary based on what the user action is on the client side.
